# python_flask
A small hiring web application developed using Python, HTML/CSS and Flask framework. 
The flask01.py file uses Flask to build API endpoints to view JSON-formatted Pythonic objects and HTML static pages.
On submit of the HTML form, user data is collected, set, and stored as cookies then returned as either a rendered HTML template or returned html block. The requests02.py uses the requests library to fetch data from the app's flask web server.
