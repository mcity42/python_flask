# python_flask
A small hiring web application developed using Python, HTML/CSS and Flask framework. 
The flask01.py file uses Flask to build API endpoints to view JSON-formatted Pythonic objects and HTML static pages.
On submit of the HTML form, Python functions collect, set, and store user data as cookies. The return is either a rendered HTML template or JSON depending on the values submitted and endpoints accessed. The requests02.py uses the requests library to fetch and view specific data from the app's flask web server, which are complex Pythonic data structures.
